    "q1": "Is it really anonymous?",
    "a1": "Yes, the platform is designed so you stay fully anonymous. We don't collect personal data and we don't log IP addresses.",
    "q2": "Can my company know it's me?",
    "a2": "No. Data is fully anonymous and displayed only in aggregate. Since anyone can submit data for any company and position, it's impossible to link it to a specific person.",
    "q3": "When will salary statistics be published?",
    "a3": "Data publication depends on community activity. We're already collecting data and will publish statistics as soon as we have enough to show results. The more participation, the sooner data appears on the platform. Follow us for updates.",
    "q4": "Why do you need this data?",
    "a4": "Armenia's IT market has limited salary transparency, and many professionals don't know if they're fairly compensated, even within their own company. Our goal is to create a more open and healthy environment around salaries, where decisions are based on real data, not assumptions.",
    "q5": "Can I submit someone else's salary?",
    "a5": "Absolutely. You can submit salary data for any position you know about — yours, a friend's, or a colleague's. What matters most is accuracy: only share data you're confident is correct. All submissions are completely anonymous.",
    "q6": "How to suggest new features?",
    "a6": "DevCareer.am is a community-driven platform, and its development is shaped by your participation. We are open to any suggestions, ideas, or questions and will gladly discuss your proposals. Contact us.",
